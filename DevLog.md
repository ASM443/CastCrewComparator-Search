The purpose of this project is to get my feet wet with web development. This app will will use Rails and Tailwinds and have a Rails API. First I will make a simple ruby project that scrapes the imdb fullcast page then find the cast and crew members in common add their IMDB page to a list. Next I will translate the project to a rails app with a pretty interface using Tail winds.

I made a script (simple_demo/ccc.rb) that uses the imdb API to get all the cast and crew from a film or show and finds the people in common. I don't need to scrape the imdb page since the API is better. Next I will build a rails app and try to implment to same thing just with basic text.
